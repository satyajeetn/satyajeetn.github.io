I am a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.georgetown.edu) at [Georgetown University](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=georgetown+university&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), where I am part of the [Theory Group](https://cstheory-georgetown.github.io). Prior to this, I was a master’s student at Georgetown, where I was and still am fortunate to be advised by [Sasha Golovnev](https://golovnev.org).

I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and particularaly, Circuit Complexity and Randomness Extraction.

**MISCELLANEOUS**  
Outside of work I like to climb, bike and hike. Amongst some of the places I have climbed include the New River Gorge, Carderock, Staunton State Park, Annapolis Rock, Joshua Tree Natioanal Park. Yes, I am on mountain project and the guy in the [green sunhoodie](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/110261733/infatuation) is me!
